### Update Details:
- [x] Add logic so the ball resets to the bottom on a successful “hole-in”
- [x] Improve shot logic by making the input pointer’s relative x-position shoot the ball in the correct x direction
- [x] Make one obstacle move left/right and bounce against the screen edges
- [x] Create and display (1) a shot counter (2) score (“hole-in”) and (3) successful shot percentage
