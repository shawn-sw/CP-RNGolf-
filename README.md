Update Details:

Add logic so the ball resets to the bottom on a successful “hole-in”
Improve shot logic by making the input pointer’s relative x-position shoot the ball in the correct x direction
Make one obstacle move left/right and bounce against the screen edges
Create and display (1) a shot counter (2) score (“hole-in”) and (3) successful shot percentage
